# UDP-Publisher-Subscriber

## Info
There are a lot of examples of how to implement a UDP server client, but not a publisher subscriber via UDP.

It's interesting to see how we lose some data when sending by UDP.

## How to Execute
* `git clone  https://github.com/FelipMarti/UDP-Publisher-Subscriber.git`
* `cd UDP-Publisher-Subscriber`
* `make`
* `./udp-subscriber`
* `./udp-publisher` (in another terminal)
